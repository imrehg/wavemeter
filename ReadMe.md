Wavemeter
=========

Web app for our institute's laboratory to distribute wavelength meter 
reading though a modern architecture. It is currently experimental, 
testing different ideas for techs and ways of doing things.

Future
------

 * Full API to query wavelength readings and set control parameters
 * WebSockets real-time data distribution
 * Multiple clients (web, mobile)
 * Long term logging, monitor and recall
